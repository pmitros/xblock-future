xblock-future
=============

Proposed future functionality for xblocks

To use, add the decorator @futureclass to your XBlock. 

This will resolve: 

1. Studio naming issues
2. Grading interface

Do keep in mind the code is relatively (in some cases, completely)
untested. If it doesn't work for you, please fix it and give me a
PR. ;)
